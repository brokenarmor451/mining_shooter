Mining Shooter

A space shooter game where you battle asteroids and mine valuable resources. Destroy asteroids in combat zones to earn coins, which can be used to upgrade your pickaxe. Explore mining zones to collect ores that enhance and upgrade your spaceship.

In combat zones, smaller asteroids grow stronger over time—their health increases every 30 seconds up to a fixed maximum. The number of coins you earn from destroying an asteroid is equal to its health.

In mine zones, blocks cannot be mined if they are blocked by other blocks. Players must start digging from the topmost layer. A rock or ore can only be mined if at least one of its sides is free—there must be no adjacent block blocking it.
